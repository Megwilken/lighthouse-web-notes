### Tips

Try experimenting withg the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===` , etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the node command.

Work on your code iteratively - that means in small pieces

To help you figure our how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime)
}
```
